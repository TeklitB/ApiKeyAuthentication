# API Key Authentication
API Key authentication is a way of authenticate clients and authorize access to endpoints.
API Key is a unique identifier that a client app sends a long with a request to identify itself and get authenticated.
API keys are commonly used to:
  - Identify API consumer clients
  - Rate limit requests coming from clients
  - Revoke individual client access
  - Analyze API usage of consumer clients

There are different approaches to implement API Key authentication. Some of the approaches are:
  - Custom Attribute
  - Custom Middleware
  - Endpoint filters with minimal APIs
  - Policy-based Authorization
